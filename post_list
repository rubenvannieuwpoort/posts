Division by constant signed integers	division-by-constant-signed-integers	Division is a relatively slow operation. When the divisor is constant, the division can be optimized significantly. In the previous post I explored how this can be done for unsigned integers. In this follow-up post, I cover how we can optimize division by constant signed integers.	2023-02-01
Division by constant unsigned integers	division-by-constant-unsigned-integers	Most modern processors have an integer divide instruction which is relatively slow compared to the other arithmetic operations. When the divisor is known at compile-time or the same divisor is used for many divisions, it is possible to transform the single division to a series of instructions which execute faster. Most compilers will optimize divisions in this way. In this article, I give an overview of the existing techniques for unsigned integers.	2023-02-01
